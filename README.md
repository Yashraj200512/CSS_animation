# CSS Animation Practice

This repository contains simple CSS animation projects I created for practice. It includes:

- **Button Animation** – A visually styled button with hover and click effects.
- **Loading Animation** – A smooth and minimal loader animation using pure CSS.

## Folder Structure

CSS_animation/  
├── button/ → Contains the button animation files  
└── loading/ → Contains the loading animation files  

## Purpose

This project is purely for learning and improving my CSS animation skills. Each folder has its own HTML showcasing different animation effects using keyframes, transitions, and basic styling.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Yashraj200512/CSS_animation.git`  
2. Navigate into the folder you want (`button` or `loading`)
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
